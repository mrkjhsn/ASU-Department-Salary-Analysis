# ASU-Department-Salary-Analysis
Which departments at ASU have the largest salary expenditures, and how has this changed over the last 5 years?  The State Press has published the [datasets](http://www.statepress.com/article/2017/04/spinvestigative-salary-database) of all salaries paid to ASU employees over the past 6 years(2012 - 2018).

#### Questions:

Trends in the number of departments created and disolved each year?
    - Salary spend on departments created has always exceeded salary spend on departments disolved
    - Count of deparments created and disolved has generally increased each year, with departments disolved tracking more predictably than departments disolved.
    - For 2016 there was a significant drop in *salary* for departments added and removed which doesn't show up in the *count* of departments added and removed for 2016.  

#### Other things to consider: 

1. ASU marketing materials make a big deal about how it is ranked #1 in inovation.  Can the percent change in salaries over the past 6 years be an effective indicator as to the direction ASU is taking as it positions itself as an innovator?
