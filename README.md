# ASU-Department-Salary-Analysis
Which departments at ASU have the largest salary expenditures, and how has this changed over the last 5 years.

The State Press has published the [datasets](http://www.statepress.com/article/2017/04/spinvestigative-salary-database) of all salaries paid to ASU employees over the past 5 years.  I was interested in seeing which departments were paying the largest amounts in salary.  

I have heard college football coaching staff are paid huge sums.  This was bourn out in my analysis.  Additionally, over the last five years the amount spent on athletic salaries has increased more than any other department receiving in excess of 10M in salary.

As I continue to get better with SQL this was an opportunity for me to use two subselects, along with an inner join.

#### Other things to consider: 

1. how the distribution of incomes in the Sun Devil Athletics department compares to the distribution across the campus.  For instance, what percent of earners make up the top 50% of the salary paid within each department.
2. can the percent change in salaries over the past 5 years be an effective indicator as to the direction ASU is taking as it positions itself as an innovator?
